# Linux File System Basics

Linux supports *conventional, flash storage, database and special purpose*
file systems

## Partitions

A partition is a physically contiguous section of a disk, while a file system
is a method of storing and locating files on the disk

## File System Hierarchy Standard

Everything comes under the root folder ```/```. The file system from the root
folder has a standard set of folders as follows:

- ```bin/``` essential user command binaries

- ```boot/``` static files of bootloader

- ```dev/``` device files

- ```etc/``` host specific system configuration

- ```home/``` user home directories

- ```lib/``` essential shared libraries and kernel modules

- ```media/``` mount point for removable devices

- ```mnt/``` mount point for temporary mount file systems

- ```opt/``` add-on app s/w packages

- ```sbin/``` system binaries

- ```srv/``` data for services provided by this system

- ```tmp/``` temporary files

- ```usr/``` (multi) user utilities and applications

- ```var/``` variable files

- ```root/``` home directory for root user

- ```proc/``` virtual file system documenting kernel and process status as text
files
