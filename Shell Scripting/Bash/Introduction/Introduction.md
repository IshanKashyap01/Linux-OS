# Introduction to Bash Scripting

- `Bash` stands for `Bourne Again Shell` as a better version for the Bourne Shell

- It is a command line interface (`CLI`) for Linux

- CLIs such as `Bash`, `Command Prompt` etc. are called *shells* because they
wrap around the OS hiding its complexity

- Moreover, they let us interact with the OS through various commands

- A `shell script` automates the commands we write on the shell

- A shell script is determined by the extension `.sh`

- You can run any script on the shell by typing its path
