# Built-in Variables

1. `$SHELL` returns the path to the current shell

2. `$RANDOM` returns a random number

3. `$USER` returns the name of the current user

4. `$PWD` returns the current working directory

5. `$HOSTNAME` returns the name of your machine

- You can create your own variables on the CLI just like you did in the file

- However, they won't be available to any child processes (like a bash script)

- The variable will remain in memory for the entire session
