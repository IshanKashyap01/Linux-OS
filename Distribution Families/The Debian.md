# The Debian Family

- The Debian distribution is upstream for several other distros such as **Ubuntu**
which in turn is upstream for *Linux Mint* and many others

- It is a pure open-source community project

- It has a strong focus on stability

- It is commonly used on servers and desktops and widely used for cloud deployments

- It provides by far the largest and most complete software repository

- Ubuntu provides a good compromise b/w *long-term stability* and *ease of use*

- It uses a **DPKG-based apt** package manager
